# photonBloom
Photon-Number Resolving Spatial + Temporal Multiplex Detector Ecosystem

- The subroutine folder contains scripts which provide abstracted (very general) functions such as cross correlation and fast histogram binning

- The pipeline scripts are experimental/exploratory, where their development would lead to more established subroutine scripts being created along the way

- big_tagger, client_object, server_object and blossom are part of the direct hardware interfacing...they seem to be far easier than data processing

- Dev Note: Please do NOT push raw data files onto the repository unless it is a static reference document (EG configuration JSON which should NOT be deleted). Please create a folder called output in your local clone and output datafiles there. Folders called data and output are ignored (see .gitignore)

- If data has to be shared, use onedrive, it's great!

- Also, please PULL before PUSHING as usual :D
